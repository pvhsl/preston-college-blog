                            <div class="post-body">
                                <p>During winter break, students usually want to leisure away and relax themselves to regain their composure for the next semester. However, I think it is very important to work on something that the people around you are surprised.</p>
                                <p>Even if it is in small steps, you are still able to achieve it as long as you put your mind to it. For instance as a sophomore, I want to get back into exercising this winter break. I haven't exercised since this summer.</p>
                                <p>My plan is to start easy, taking small steps to build muscle memory and allow my body to adapt to the pressure of the exercise. After that, I'll resume into more intense training.</p>
                                <p>Another goal is to resume studying Japanese. I'm currently at the N5 level of Japanese, but I'd like to complete N4 and achieve N4-level fluency.</p>
                                <p>There's a chance that students from Fukuoka will be visiting next semester, so I want to continue learning and speaking Japanese. This is an action that asks, "Why?" You should inspire yourself to ask that question.</p>
