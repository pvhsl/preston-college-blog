                        <h2 class="post-title">What to do during your college winter break?</h2>
                        
                        <div class="post-body">
                            <p>During winter break, students usually want to leisure away and relax themselves to regain their composure for the next semester.
                                However, I think it is very important to work on something that the people around you are surprised. 
                                People who devote their whole body and soul to the work in front of them to get something, and they are working hard, various opportunities will come around.</p>
                            <p>Even if it is in small steps, you are still able to achieve it as long as you put your mind to it.
                            For instance as a sophomore, I want to get back into exercising this winter break. I haven't exercised since this summer. My academics and part-time work schedules have kept me from exercising since the summer.
                            Maybe I'm just not good at time management. My plan is to start easy, taking small steps to build muscle memory and allow my body to adapt to the pressure of the exercise.
                            After that, I'll resume into more intense training with a combination of calisthenics and multivariate dumbbell exercises. This is just one of the goals I have to complete during winter break</p>
                            <p> Another thing I'd like to point out is that goals achieved during winter break can be continued and become a habit throughout spring and summer. If you continue exercising after winter break,
                            you may see results that exceed your expectations. Another goal is to resume studying Japanese. I'm currently at the N5 level of Japanese, but I'd like to complete N4 and achieve N4-level fluency.
                            My plan is to understand grammar, watch intensive Japanese videos, and preferably speak to Japanese people online.
                            </p>
                            <p> That is another thing I want to point out, ask "why do I want to complete this goal?" To illustrate, I heard from the Associate Director of International Programs that Japanese students from Fukuoka would be visiting our town as part of a study abroad program. 
                                Thanks to the Director, I had the opportunity to speak with students from Chiba and Fukuoka last year, which motivated me to continue studying Japanese. 
                                There's a chance that students from Fukuoka will be visiting next semester, so I want to continue learning and speaking Japanese. This is an action that asks, "Why?"
                                You should inspire yourself to ask that question.</p>
                            <p>For other students reading this, this may not be the most inspiring or the article to seek out,
                            but it does give you a good idea of ​​what possibilities you can develop over the winter break.</p>
