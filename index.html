                            <h2 class="post-title">What to do during your college winter break?</h2>
                            <div class="post-body">
                                <p>During winter break, students usually want to leisure away and relax themselves to regain their composure for the next semester. However, I think it is very important to work on something that the people around you are surprised.</p>
                                <p>Even if it is in small steps, you are still able to achieve it as long as you put your mind to it. For instance as a sophomore, I want to get back into exercising this winter break. I haven't exercised since this summer.</p>
                               <p> That is another thing I want to point out, ask "why do I want to complete this goal?" </p>
                                  <p> To illustrate, I heard from the Associate Director of International Programs that Japanese students from Fukuoka would be visiting our town as part of a study abroad program.
                                Thanks to the Director, I had the opportunity to speak with students from Chiba and Fukuoka last year, which motivated me to continue studying Japanese. 
                                There's a chance that students from Fukuoka will be visiting next semester, so I want to continue learning and speaking Japanese. </p>
                              <p>This is an action that asks, "Why?"
                                You should inspire yourself to ask that question. </p>
                            <p>For other students reading this, this may not be the most inspiring or the article to seek out,
                            but it does give you a good idea of ​​what possibilities you can develop over the winter break.</p>
